## About Tele Donut üç©

[Tele Donut](https://farina00.github.io/tele.donut) is a super simple website that, by using today's technologies, can stream tv.

And, it doesn't store any video file. 

The website simply soft-codes a few external links to publicly available video stream URLs, 
which, to the best of my knowledge, have been intentionally made publicly by the copyright holders. 

The selection of channels - external links to m3u8 files - is sourced from https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv

If any link infringe on your rights as a copyright holder, 
please [open an issue](https://github.com/farina00/tele.donut/issues) and I will remove it.
